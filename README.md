# Pool simulator ðŸŽ±

## Getting started (development)

Start by cloning this project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wilmot208/pool-simulator.git
```

This project is written in Python 3.  
We strongly recommend using Python virtual environments.

To create a virtual environment, first install `virtualenv` (you may need to run this with `sudo -H`):

```sh
pip install virtualenv
```

`cd` to the project directory and create your virtual environment:

```sh
cd pool-simulator
virtualenv env
```

Activate your virtual environment (you will need to do this for every new terminal session):

```sh
source ./env/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You are now ready to develop!
